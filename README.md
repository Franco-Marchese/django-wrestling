# Data base model.
<image src="/photos/dbWrestling.png" alt="navbar">
  
Here is how the data base was design to fullfil the basic data storage that a wrestling club in development needs. A couple of this tables are displayed to the front end.
The idea it is to give to the club as much freedom as possible about the modification of the displayed info. That why some tables may appear useful for just one register.
  
# Django admin.
For the back end, the default django admin was implemented. As a solid tool to help with this web app developtment wich had a little bit less than 6 months to being ready to launch in his initial versi√≥n.
